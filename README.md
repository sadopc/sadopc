# hey, I'm serdar

I create software tools which I want to actually use — mostly for macOS and terminal environments.

I currently work on systems programming while developing TUI applications which provide better user experience than existing solutions.

## my created projects

**macOS applications**
- [machscope](https://github.com/sadopc/machscope) — mach-o binary analysis: parsing, arm64 disassembly, code signatures
- [ScreenCapture](https://github.com/sadopc/ScreenCapture) — screenshot + annotation tool for the menu bar
- [EdaCam](https://github.com/sadopc/EdaCam) — screen recorder with hardware-accelerated encoding
- [edaboard](https://github.com/sadopc/edaboard) — clipboard manager that stays out of the way

**command line applications**
- [gottp](https://github.com/sadopc/gottp) — postman but in your terminal (built with bubble tea)
- [godu](https://github.com/sadopc/godu) — disk usage analyzer with tree view and treemap
- [trackr](https://github.com/sadopc/trackr) — time tracker with pomodoro, projects, and reports

**research projects**
- [rustgresql](https://github.com/sadopc/rustgresql) — postgresql-compatible database from scratch in rust
- [unified-db](https://github.com/sadopc/unified-db) — gpu-accelerated sqlite using apple silicon's unified memory
- [alt-rosetta](https://github.com/sadopc/alt-rosetta) — x86_64 to arm64 binary translator for macos
- [NeuralSwift](https://github.com/sadopc/NeuralSwift) — neural net from scratch in swift with metal gpu acceleration

## my programming languages

I use swift, go, rust, c, typescript and python for my work.

I welcome people to work with me on exciting projects. You can contact me by creating an issue on any repository or through this page.
